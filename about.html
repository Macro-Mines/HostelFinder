                    <p>For countless students and their parents, finding the right hostel near a new university can be a daunting and time-consuming task. The challenges are numerous:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="bullet-icon">&#10003;</span> Lack of Centralized Information: Scattered listings, outdated contact details, and unreliable information make it hard to compare options effectively.</li>
                        <li><span class="bullet-icon">&#10003;</span> Limited Transparency: Unclear pricing, hidden charges, and vague facility descriptions can lead to unpleasant surprises.</li>
                        <li><span class="bullet-icon">&#10003;</span> Time Constraints: The pressure of admissions and moving means students often have little time to conduct thorough research.</li>
                        <li><span class="bullet-icon">&#10003;</span> Distance Barriers: Researching hostels in a new city or state from afar adds significant logistical hurdles.</li>
